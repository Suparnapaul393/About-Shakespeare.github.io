		<h2>Why To Study Shakespeare?</h2>
		<p>Shakespeare’s works are timeless.  After four hundred years, people still read, study, and perform his plays and poetry. It is important to study Shakespeare because it is a part of popular culture.  Popular culture refers to movies, television, and songs.</p>
		<li>Reason 1: Some Shakespeare lines are used in every day conversation among educated people. </li>
		<li>Reason 2: Shakespeare’s writings, particularly his plays, prompt us to imagine the complex lives lived by his characters.</li>
		<li>Reason 3: The three types of irony – dramatic, verbal, and situational – are all present in Shakespeare’s writing, thus making them easy to learn.</li><br>
		<p>Shakespeare used a metrical pattern consisting of lines of unrhymed iambic pentameter, called blank verse. His plays were composed using blank verse, although there are passages in all the plays that deviate from the norm and are composed of other forms of poetry and/or simple prose.<br></p>
<p>Shakespeare's sonnets are written in iambic pentameter, with the exception of Sonnet 145, which is written in iambic tetrameter. Shakespeare's style of writing and metre choice were typical of the day, and other writings of the time influenced how he structured his compositions.</p><br>
<p>Shakespeare influenced every generation of writers since his death and he continues to have an enormous impact on contemporary plays, movies, and poems. The Romantic poet John Keats (1795-1821) was so influenced by Shakespeare that he kept a bust of the Bard beside him while he wrote, hoping that Shakespeare would spark his creativity. Keats's poems duplicate Shakespeare's style and are full of Shakespearean imagery. </p><br>
		<p>Shakespeare is great because he just wrote better than anyone else on these matters—delving more deeply, exploring more nuance, writing more eloquently and movingly than any other playwright then or since.Shakespeare wanted audiences to react. He wanted people to cheer and boo at his characters.</p>
